# README Generator: Node.js

## Project Description

I wanted to build a command-line application for developers, to provide them a speedy alternative to writing a README.md. Encouraging developers to devote more time to their project while still having a high-quality, detailed README.md for the user to navigate their product.

## Tasks

---

- Prompt the developer in the command line a series of questions
- The readme should contain the following: The Title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Github Link, Contact and Tests.
- The Developer should be able to choose the license badge appropriate for their project.
- The Table Contents should direct the user to the corresponding section for the README.md for easier navigation.

## README Generator Walk Through
